    "Consider a statement whose truth is unknown. If we see many examples that are compatible with it, we are tempted to view the statement as more probable. Such reasoning is often referred to as _inductive inference_ (in a philosophical, rather than mathematical sense). Consider now the statement that \"all cows are white\". An equivalent statement is that \"everything that is not white is not a cow\". We then observe several black panthers. Our observations are clearly compatible with the statement, but do they make the hypothesis \"all cows are white\" more likely?\n",
